# 8-min Presentation Outline

1. Motivation (0:45)
   - Mixed findings on autocorrect; most evidence from mobile.
   - We test if **difficulty** moderates autocorrect benefits on **desktop**.

2. Research Question & Hypotheses (0:30)
   - Does autocorrect improve WPM and reduce CER?
   - Is the benefit larger on HARD prompts?

3. Experimental Design (1:15)
   - 2×2 within-subject (AUTO/OFF × EASY/HARD), randomized, balanced.
   - DVs: WPM, CER (+ repair_ms exploratory).
   - One participant, many prompts.

4. Power & Data (0:30)
   - Powered for small effect (dz≈0.25) → ~100 pairs (200 trials).
   - Final counts per cell (show small table).

5. Results (3:00)
   - Overall paired results: WPM, CER (numbers + dz + CI + p).
   - Within EASY/HARD simple effects.
   - Interaction (cond×difficulty) OLS: report β_int, p.
   - Plots: WPM boxplot; CER boxplot; WPM bar.

6. Interpretation (1:00)
   - Practical significance; when autocorrect helps/hurts.

7. Limitations & Next (0:45)
   - Single participant, desktop autocorrect model, short prompts.
   - Future: real OS keyboards, mobile vs desktop, multi-participant.

8. Takeaways (0:15)
   - Clear recommendation based on your numbers.
